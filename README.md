# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## You can take a look on our site!

### `test-yourself.vercel.app/`

## Skills used:

To develop this site, I used react.js (using its hooks for easier development) and Tailwind.css (it's basically coding css but it's more developer friendly)

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
